## Cleo Frontend Interview - Bills (Zlatko Iliev)

I have selected the first Option 1 for my task solution, because I could not spend more time on it.

### Run the app:

`npm start` and on a second terminal tab `npm run api`
This will spin up the server and the client (please note they use different ports depending on what is available)

### Notes:

The app is working, however it could be improved, if I had more time, I would split it into more reusable components.
I didn't see any need or state management library here, for small apps I usually use Context API provided by React.

If the store gets bigger and I know it will be bigger up front I would use Redux.

I hope you will be happy with my solution. Awaiting your feedback.
